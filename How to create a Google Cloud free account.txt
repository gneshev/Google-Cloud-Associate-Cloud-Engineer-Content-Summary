How to create a Google Cloud free account



To create a Google Cloud free account, go to https://cloud.google.com/free, 

sign in with your Google account, 

select your country, 

provide your payment and phone details for verification (you won't be charged unless you upgrade), 

and then complete the process to receive $300 in free credits for 90 days and access to the free tier services.

Step-by-step guide:
Navigate to the Google Cloud Free page: Open your web browser and go to cloud.google.com/free.
 
Sign in with your Google account: Click on the "Start free" or "Start here and say get started for free" button and then sign in with your existing Gmail ID or a new one.
 
Enter account information:
	Select your country from the drop-down menu. 
	Agree to the terms of service by checking the relevant box and clicking continue.
 
Set up your payment profile:
	You will need to provide a valid phone number for verification. 
	Enter your credit or debit card details. This is for verification to ensure you're not a robot and to enable future billing if you choose to upgrade beyond the free trial.
 
Activate your free trial: Click on "Start my Free Trial" to confirm and activate your account.
 
Explore Google Cloud: Once the setup is complete, you will be redirected to the Google Cloud Console. You will have $300 in free credits to use on various Google Cloud products for 90 days.

	Free tier services: You can also access a number of free tier products, like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery, up to certain usage limits.
